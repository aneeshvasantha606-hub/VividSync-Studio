    <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      “Good design doesn’t scream — it whispers meaning.”  
      Aneesh believes that every composition should guide the viewer’s eyes naturally.
      He follows a grid-based, color-psychology-driven workflow where each hue, shadow,
      and alignment serves intent. His style merges modern minimalism with futuristic energy,
      resulting in designs that are bold, balanced, and unmistakably distinct.
